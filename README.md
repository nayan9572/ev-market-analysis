# Electric Vehicles Market Analysis & Recommendation System

## What This Project Is About

I really dug into the Electric Vehicle (EV) market with this project! My main goals were to understand the market size, find interesting patterns in EV data, and then build a recommendation system to help people choose an EV based on what they need (like budget or range).

## Why I Built This (Problem Solved)

The EV market is growing fast, but it can be hard for buyers to pick the right car from so many options. On the other hand, manufacturers and dealerships need to understand market trends. I built this to:

* Provide clear insights into the EV market (e.g., popular models, battery trends).
* Offer a helpful tool for potential buyers to find EVs that match their specific criteria.

## What I Did (Key Features)

* **Data Analysis:** I explored EV datasets to uncover key market insights, like which types of EVs are most popular, trends in battery capacity, and range.
* **Pattern Identification:** I identified various patterns within the data, such as how price relates to range or battery size.
* **Recommendation System:** I developed a system that suggests electric vehicles based on user-defined inputs like budget, desired range, and battery capacity. This helps simplify the buying process.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** I also used statistical methods to test hypotheses, for example, comparing the performance or characteristics of different vehicle categories.

## Tools I Used

* **Python** (Likely used for the core analysis and recommendation system logic)
* **Core Libraries:** `pandas`, `numpy` (for data manipulation), `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualizations), `scipy.stats` (for hypothesis testing)
* *(Note: The final output of this project is presented as a PDF document.)*

## How You Can View This

This project's analysis and insights are compiled into a PDF document, which you can view directly.

1.  **Get the project files:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/nayan9572/ev-market-analysis.git](https://github.com/nayan9572/ev-market-analysis.git)
    cd ev-market-analysis
    ```

2.  **Open the PDF:**
    * Find the PDF file (e.g., `EV_Market_Analysis_Report.pdf` or similar) in the downloaded folder.
    * Open it with any PDF viewer (like Adobe Acrobat Reader or your web browser).
    * The PDF will contain all the analysis, findings, and details of the recommendation system.

## My Results and What I Learned

* I gained a clear understanding of the current EV market landscape, identifying key factors influencing consumer choice.
* I successfully developed a functional recommendation system that provides personalized EV suggestions.
* This project really strengthened my skills in data exploration, statistical analysis (especially hypothesis testing), and building practical tools from data. It also honed my ability to present complex analyses clearly in a report format.
